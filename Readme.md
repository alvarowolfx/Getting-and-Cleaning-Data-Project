Getting and Cleaning Data Project - Coursera
========================================================

The purpose of this project is to demonstrate your ability to collect, work with, and clean a data set. The goal is to prepare tidy data that can be used for later analysis. 

Project Description
========================================================

One of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now is wearable computing - see for example this article . Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data linked to from the course website represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. A full description is available at the site where the data was obtained: 

[Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

And the data for the project can be downloaded here:

The project objetive is create a R script called run_analysis.R that does the following :

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

How to use this repository solution
========================================================

Extract the archive obtained on the above description into the project directory. Set the working directory to the project folder.The R script run_analysis.r contains many labeled functions that realizes each step of the project, so the code should guide what was made to acomplish the result.

Running the R script should generate the Sumarized Tidy Data that was required to finish the project. It will be generated on the project folder.
